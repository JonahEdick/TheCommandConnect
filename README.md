# Command Connect
This is an application that allows players to connect with others to play the tabletop
skirmish game by Games Workshop, Kill Team v2.0!

## Frontend
The frontend consists of both a Web and Mobile based application that will allow users to
create games with modular settings or join a game that already exists.

### How to make a game!
If you wish to host a game, you can simply click on the "Host Game" button in the main menu
which will take you to the Create Game tab! This will allow you to create a game of Kill
Team for you and between 1 and 3 other players!

Once you enter your desired settings, you can click on "Create Game" and it will take you to
a lobby screen that will give you a lobby code which can be entered by your friends to let
them join your game!
